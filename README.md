# Newton-Raphson
# This is a simple Python script that implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of a function. The user needs to provide the function and its derivative. This script saves time by automating the calculation of successive iterations Xn and Xn+1 until convergence is achieved.

# example with F(x) =  2x^3 − 3x^2 + 2x − 3
# In console:
# X = 1.642857
# X = 1.516087
# X = 1.500234
# X = 1.5
# X = 1.5
# Root= 1.5
